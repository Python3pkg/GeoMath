Lines
=====


The line statement is the basic statement for the Euclidean Geometry and for everything in geometry. Figures are formed by lines, distances are the length of lines and even more.
Lines must be used to get general arguments, like angles, line equation, comparisons between to lines and etc.

Creating the Line
-----------------
To start with a line you may want to run these commands that are below this statement.

.. py:function:: line.Line()

To start getting a line done in the GeoMath system, you must run this command! This is an object assigned function, so you must assign it to an object so it can be called

```LINEVAR = line.Line()```


There are two ways of inputting values for a line: creating a line with 2 Points or by the Line Equation(supposing that you have it).

.. py:function:: line.Create()

To get a line assigning two different points to it, you must run this command. It will generate a line in the instance that is in your line.

```LINEVAR.Create(point.Point(0,0), point.Point(4,4))```

Running these commands, we will generate the equation of the line simply by solving the matrix represented by the two points and by the x and y line.

.. py:function:: line.CreateViaEquation()
